# MiniSB-SW-Carriage
MOD IS STILL UNTESTED, PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND REPORT ANY ISSUES/CONCERNS!

This mod is a simple mod to the Voron Switchwire toolhead carriage to be able to use the Mini-Stealthburner. Mini-Stealthburner printed parts can be found in the original Voron V0.2 repository: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0

It removes the need for the extra square mounting piece that's added on the x axis mgn-12h carriage.
