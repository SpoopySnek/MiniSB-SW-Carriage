# MiniSB-SW-Carriage
MOD IS STILL UNTESTED, PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND REPORT ANY ISSUES/CONCERNS!

This mod is a simple mod to the Voron Switchwire toolhead carriage to be able to use the Mini-Stealthburner. Mini-Stealthburner printed parts can be found in the original Voron V0.2 repository: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0

It removes the need for the extra square mounting piece that's added on the x axis mgn-12h linear guide block.

If you're planning to run a BTT EBB36 for CANBUS, I'd recommend pairing this mount w/ the MiniSB spacers: https://www.printables.com/model/320325-btt-ebb36-canbus-voron-cw2-mount-moons-pancake-mot
