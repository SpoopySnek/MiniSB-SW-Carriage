**Update Feb 03, 2023: 2nd round of revisions; overhangs shouldn't be an issue anymore.**

~~Update Jan 21, 2023: Redid design to account for overhangs.~~

This mod is a simple mod to the Voron Switchwire toolhead carriage to be able to use the Mini-Stealthburner. Mini-Stealthburner printed parts can be found in the original [Voron V0.2 repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0).

*DUE THE MAIN GOAL OF WANTING TO SHRINK THE ENTIRE TOOLHEAD PACKAGE, INDUCTIVE PROBES WILL NOT FIT!*

*Klicky **should** work, but untest*

It removes the need for the extra square mounting piece that's added on the x axis mgn-12h linear guide block:

If you're planning to run a BTT EBB36 for CANBUS, I'd recommend pairing [BTT EBB36 Canbus Voron CW2 Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/320325-btt-ebb36-canbus-voron-cw2-mount-moons-pancake-mot) w/ the MiniSB spacers.
