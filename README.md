**Update Mar 28, 2023: Klicky confirmed to fit and work.Due to how low the motor sits, any toolhead PCB/CAN board will need to go umbilical on x axis. Alpha testing in effect. EDIT: ADDED CAD FILES; UPLOADED ALT VERSION FOR INDUCTIVE PROBE TESTING**

~~Update Feb 25, 2023: 3nd round of revisions; Should have enough room for klicky/Omron inductuve probe(untested).~~

~~Update Feb 03, 2023: 2nd round of revisions; overhangs shouldn't be an issue anymore.~~

~~Update Jan 21, 2023: Redid design to account for overhangs.~~

This mod is a simple mod to the Voron Switchwire toolhead carriage to be able to use the Mini-Stealthburner. Mini-Stealthburner printed parts can be found in the original [Voron V0.2 repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0).
